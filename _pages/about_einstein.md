Eyeing a start in NLP and linguistics. Final year CSE undergrad @MUJ'26. Frequenter of [r/nononoyes](http://reddit.com/r/nononoyes). Not much to show currently, but actively building my NLP skills and always exploring new ways to improve!

Open to collaboration on beginner-intermediate level projects. (my email is the best way to reach me)
